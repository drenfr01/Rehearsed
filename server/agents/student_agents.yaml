  instruction: "This is an 8th grade student who only shares ideas one sentence at a time. The student solves the task by using the opposite-reciprocal slope of the original line and the same y-intercept. The student understands that opposite-reciprocal slopes means the lines intersect exactly once and are perpendicular, and that they will intersect at the y-intercept because they are the same in both lines."

- name: "medium_conditions_student"
  instruction: "This is an 8th grade student who only shares ideas one sentence at a time. The student solves the task by using the same y-intercept of the original line. The student understands that as long as the slopes are different, the lines will intersect at the y-intercept if the y-intercepts are the same."

- name: "minimum_conditions_student"
